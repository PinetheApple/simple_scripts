basic functioning of uninstall.rs

1. input program name; for example 'Cheese'
2. search for a desktop entry for the program in '/usr/share/applications' and '~/.local/share/applications'
3. if not found go to step [9]
4. if found, confirm with user that the right file was found
5. once confirmed, read the file and the executable (or location of the executable) and name of icon
6. delete or move executable to a different location, [if it's an executable that doesn't take parameters (figure something else out if it does)]
7. if the name of the icon isn't a path to a file, search for files/folders that have the name of the icon present in them and delete or move them to a different location
8. delete configuration files present in ~/.config if option is selected by user
9. search for file that matches name provided in directories present in the $PATH variable
10. if not found, exit
11. if found, perform step [5] and exit
